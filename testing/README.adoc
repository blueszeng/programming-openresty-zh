= 自动化测试

自动化测试在软件开发和维护中起着重要的作用。
OpenResty 提供了一个数据驱动的测试框架，可以为 NGINX C 模块、Lua 库、甚至 OpenResty 应用，编写声明式测试用例。
测试用例是以一种规范的格式写成的，既有直观的可读性和可维护性，也易于机器的处理。
数据驱动的方法使的在不同的情况下，
OpenResty provides a data-driven test scaffold for writing declarative test cases for NGINX C modules, Lua libraries, and even OpenResty applications. The test cases are written in a specification-like format, which is both intuitive to read and write for humans and also easy to handle for machines. The data-driven approach makes it easy to run the same tests in wildly different ways that can help expose issues in different scenarios or with different kinds of external tools.

This chapter introduces the `Test::Nginx` test scaffold that has been widely used to organize test suites for almost all the OpenResty components, including the `ngx_http_lua` module, most of the `lua-resty-*` Lua libraries, as well as full-blown business applications like CloudFlare's Lua CDN and Lua SSL.
